# Neognosis Workflow Tools
Welcome to the Neognosis Workflow Tools repository! Here you can find development tools for BallisticNG.

Documentation on the repo is currently a work in progress. You can find documentation from the old google drive location here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dOVK3DJJd3EY-c0cU5vLtOajyfDikaU7?usp=sharing

# Blender Addons
The Blender Addons folder contains lots of utilities for Blender that will help with BallisticNG track development. The most important one is **NeoTileMap**, which contains the Blender portion of the Tilemap Builder utility.


# Tilemap Builder
The Tilemap Builder folder contains builds of the program with the same name. It's a standalone program written in Unity to aid with creating UV rects out of existing images or building texture atlases with diffuse, illumination and reflection masks entirely from scratch.

It's currently available for Windows and Linux.
