# Moving
The Neognosis Workflow Tools are being separated out into individual repositories for improved release rollouts and to provide pre-configured Pycharm projects for others to develop off of. This repository will eventually become just a readme to point to everything.

### Blender Addons:
* [NeoTileMap](https://github.com/Neognosis-Workflow/NeoTileMap)
* [NeoTrm](https://github.com/Neognosis-Workflow/NeoTrm)
* [NeoModeling](https://github.com/Neognosis-Workflow/NeoModeling)
* [NeoObjects](https://github.com/Neognosis-Workflow/NeoObjects)

# Neognosis Workflow Tools
Welcome to the Neognosis Workflow Tools repository! Here you can find development tools for BallisticNG.

[See the wiki for documentation](https://github.com/bigsnake09/Neognosis-Workflow-Tools/wiki)

# Blender Addons
The Blender Addons folder contains lots of utilities for Blender that will help with BallisticNG track development. The most important one is **NeoTileMap**, which contains the Blender portion of the Tilemap Builder utility.

# Tilemap Builder
The Tilemap Builder folder contains builds of the program with the same name. It's a standalone program written in Unity to aid with creating UV rects out of existing images or building texture atlases with diffuse, illumination and reflection masks entirely from scratch.

It's currently available for Windows and Linux.

# Can I use these tools for non BallisticNG use?
Yes! If you find these tools useful for your workflow in non BallisticNG artwork then please feel free to use them. We ask for nothing in return, although a credit would be appreciated :)
